# About this document {-}

This document contains instructions on how to use selected popular statistical models. Data analyses are carried out using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), but many comments can be read without prior knowledge of R. The document is aimed at students (at all levels) enrolled at the Faculty of Sciences at University of Copenhagen. 

Examples and comments are continuously expanded and are strongly inspired by real problems that have been presented to us by students at our [statistics consultations](https://datalab.science.ku.dk/english/consultations/).

This document has been created using the [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/) R package.
